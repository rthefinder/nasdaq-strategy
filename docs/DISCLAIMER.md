# Disclaimer

## IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

### Not a Security

**nasdaq-strategy** is NOT a registered security. It is NOT registered with the SEC, FINRA, or any other financial regulatory authority in any jurisdiction. The tokens are NOT offered as securities and the protocol is NOT subject to securities regulations.

### Not an ETF

While this protocol shares structural similarities with ETF mechanics (treasury backing, NAV calculation, redemption), it is **NOT** an Exchange-Traded Fund. It is NOT regulated as an ETF. There is NO fund manager, NO custodian, and NO regulated entity managing this protocol.

### No Nasdaq Affiliation

**nasdaq-strategy is NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, approved by, or associated with Nasdaq, Inc.** 

The use of "nasdaq" in the protocol name is purely for reference to the index exposure strategy that the protocol aims to implement. This protocol operates independently and is a community-driven decentralized protocol.

Nasdaq, Inc. has NO involvement in this project and bears NO responsibility for it.

### Not Financial Advice

Nothing in this project, including documentation, code, or communications from team members, constitutes financial advice, investment advice, or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold the token.

You are solely responsible for your own investment decisions. Consult a professional financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

### Risk of Total Loss

Like all cryptocurrency assets, **there is a significant risk of total loss**. The value of the token and treasury holdings may:

- Decline to zero
- Become illiquid and impossible to sell
- Be lost due to smart contract bugs or exploits
- Be seized by government action
- Become worthless for regulatory reasons

**Only invest money you can afford to lose completely.**

### No Guarantees

There are NO guarantees of:
- Any return on investment
- Any increase in token value

- Availability of the protocol

### Smart Contract Risk

This project uses smart contracts that:
- May contain bugs or vulnerabilities
- Have NOT been formally verified
- May behave unexpectedly

**This protocol may become illegal or regulated in your jurisdiction.** It is your responsibility to understand the laws in your jurisdiction.

### Liquidity Risk

- DEX liquidity may be insufficient
- Large redemptions may not be possible
- Treasury USDC may be depleted
- Trading volume may disappear
- Market price may diverge significantly from NAV

### Market Risk

- Index proxy holdings may decline in value
- Nasdaq exposure may underperform expectations
- Market crashes may trigger cascading losses
- Correlation may break between proxies and real index

### No Insurance

- No insurance covers losses

- No private insurance backing
- Token holders bear 100% of risk

### Technology Assumptions

This protocol assumes:
- Solana blockchain continues to operate

**There are NO promised returns or expectations of returns.** While the protocol is designed to accumulate treasury assets, there is NO guarantee that:
